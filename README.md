Hello world =)
<strong>Welcome to Think or Just-do-it app. </strong> 
This repo contains an application helps people write down tasks, filter them
based on them being done or not OR helps them to find things to add to their to-do list, meaning gives them time to think in hypnotizing jumping balls.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
 
## UX (User Experience)
 This website is desigened to be responsive on a range of devices which is smooth to navigate for potential people seeking a to-do app or fun way for spacing out and it showcases the developers skill in javascript, the main focus for the website’s owner is to present his app for other people to help them write down tasks and manifest their ideas digitally.
 Potential website visitors can simply add their tasks or space-out a little bit in a fun GUI.

- ### User stories

  - A user can add tasks to the app.
  - A user can filter the task to see which one are open, done or both.
  - To be able to effortlessly navigate the website to find the right web application.
  - To be able to find information about the app, through the modal.

- ### Design

  - #### Image:

    - The image I found on (pixabay) represents what I tryiec to create digitally.
      It's well taken, with a clean mess around.

  - #### Color:

    - The color used are colormap linear gradient of the color schemes purple, white and blue and at most of the design purple is the color progression dominant.
      I choose the color purple because it's often assosiated with wisdom, creativity and magic.Purple as well is the balancing color between red and blue’s color psychologies, and while red brings energy to the color, blue brings relaxation and stability, together they make purple the perfect balance of the two.
      [Color Psychology](http://www.artitudesdesign.com/purple-color-psychology/) says that it “can have calming effects over the mind and nerves, it can be uplifting and can trigger creativity.”
    - Color inspired from [dribble](https://dribbble.com).

  - #### Typography:

    - The sexy fonts used within the website are Exo and Roboto fonts. Sans Serif font is used a well as a fallback font if the browser is not compatible with the fonts.

- As a Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the developer.

  1.  When Entering the site users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a button that takes you to the footer.
  2.  The main points are concluded immediately within the hero image and the short text provided.
  3.  The navigation bar has the “About me” link that takes the user to the About section for more information about the developer and what they’re capable of.

  1.  The users have three options:

      1.  Click the call to action button that takes to a another tab with the CV presented in PDF.
      2.  The navigation bar items that takes them to their section of choice, and in small devices clicking on the burger icon drops down the hidden navigation items. User has the about me section to get to know the developer and the Say Hello section too.
      3.  Scroll down to explore the different website’s sections.

  2.  I want to be able to find information about the developer's skilss.

  3.  I want to be able to contact the developer for a project idea.
